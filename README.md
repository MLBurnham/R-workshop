# R-workshop
 
Here you will find slides and materials from the introduction to R workshop. The bulk of the material covered in class can be found in the complete_notebooks folder.

This workshop is primarily focused on helping you to think programmatically, learn how to troubleshoot, and break down large problems into smaller more tractable problems. We will introduce you to some functions and packages, but this is not the primary goal of the workshop. Rather than trying to teach you R in a week, my objective is to set your expectations and give you the tools to teach yourself over the next few years.
